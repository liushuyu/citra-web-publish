      <description>It has been more than a year since the last progress report, not for lack of progress, but for lack of writers. To fill in the gap, developers jroweboy and FearlessTobi independently wrote drafts for a new progress report, and another developer zhaowenlan1779 merged their works and added more content. Together, we are able to present you with an update on all the changes we&amp;rsquo;ve had since 2019 Q1.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone to the summer (or winter, for those on the southern half of this Earth) edition of Citra&amp;rsquo;s progress reports. Although not very many large changes have been made, many fixes have focused on accuracy improvements and implementing some of the sorely needed user experience features.
Before we go further into this, our Patreon poll results are out. We asked our patrons, which feature they would like to see us work on next and they delivered.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while folks - since the last report, we have had many new features come to Citra. Some notable ones include multiplayer improvements, hardware shader improvements (post GLvtx), a logging system rewrite, and the highly coveted camera support. Our continuous integration (CI) systems were optimized as well. Apart from these, we have had many more minor features, improvements, and bug fixes. So, without further ado let&amp;rsquo;s get right into it:</description>

      <description>New year, new changes in Citra. Specifically, lots of technical changes under the hood, from applets to IPC, have made Citra even more accurate and laid a foundation for even more goodies the next year. With many great changes all around, this article is going to be packed to the brim with all the new goodies that have come to Citra during those crimson months.
But, enough faffing about! Let&amp;rsquo;s get right into it:</description>

      <description>Winter arrives once more, and like I mentioned in August&amp;rsquo;s progress report, I am extremely excited for what&amp;rsquo;s in store. In fact, many of the really big goodies I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to seperate to their own articles, which should be coming up in the next few weeks.
There&amp;rsquo;s also been many changes this month that improve the speed of emulation across the board, on top of the usual improvements in accuracy and features.</description>

      <description>Networked Multiplayer is one of those features that was so surprising to see, that the lucky few chosen to test it were wondering if it was real. For the past year, several developers have banded together to bring this amazing implementation of online play to Citra.
 The Nintendo 3DS heavily relies on wireless for its slew of multiplayer compatible titles. Considering that so many games feel empty without their multiplayer features, we&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce that in select titles, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play together with your friends across the world in the latest Canary builds of Citra!</description>

      <description>Emulators grow quickly. Last month alone, there were 39 pull requests merged to Citra. For this reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to manage the many different versions of an emulator. Until now however, Citra has had no installer or updater for the nightly builds. Although the now obsolete Bleeding Edge builds did have both of these things, it was limited to Windows, and the installer framework had some issues that restricted what we could do with it.</description>

      <description>2017 has been an amazing year, with more work having been put into the project than ever before, but it&amp;rsquo;s not over yet! Last we met was June, and just two months later the Citra issue tracker is brimming with lots of changes once more. I am extremely excited for this month (and what&amp;rsquo;s coming up the next few months) but we&amp;rsquo;re getting ahead of ourselves! On this progress report, let&amp;rsquo;s check out the big fish in the July and August pond of patches!</description>

      <description>Citra has some issues, and by its nature as an open source project, they are visible to everyone and fixable by anyone. Unfortunately though, most contributions are made by a small minority of developers. These developers have found it difficult to prioritize their efforts, since the majority of issue reports are written scattered across Discord, Reddit, forums, IRC, and too many other places to count.
Because of this, the Citra team has put together a framework to report data about how Citra is used to our server, and use that data to discover what are the most popular games and hardware configurations, where emulated games crash in Citra most often, and more.</description>

      <description>The summer of 2017 has just rolled in, and although we don&amp;rsquo;t have a summer of code, the patches continue rolling in regardless. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a ton of fixes this month in the renderer, so this report is going to be very screenshot heavy. With that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s get right to it. Implemented Procedural Texture (Texture Unit 3) by wwylele There is a rarely used feature in the 3DS&amp;rsquo; GPU called procedural textures, &amp;ldquo;proctex&amp;rdquo; for short.</description>

      <description>As game compatibility has broadened and the popularity of Citra has risen there&amp;rsquo;s always been a lack of consistent information on what could be played in Citra and what couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Often times the best way to find out if a game was working properly in Citra was to jump in and test it for yourself, but if any issues were encountered you&amp;rsquo;d be left scouring through forums sifting through potentially out of date information for answers.</description>

      <description>In the last quarter, we&amp;rsquo;ve further improved the speed and accuracy of citra along with supporting more 3DS features, and we are very excited to show what we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard to believe, but Citra is already three years old, and in these three years we&amp;rsquo;ve gone from an emulator that could barely run homebrew, to one that can run many commercially available games at playable speeds!</description>

      <description>As we approach the first birthday of Citra&amp;rsquo;s website, we&amp;rsquo;d like to announce yet another project infrastructure update:
We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to launch a new forum based on the Discourse forum software!
When we first introduced the new website back in February of 2016, we chose to use Flarum over more classic forums used on other websites (such as phpBB, MyBB, or vBulletin). The reason for this was because Flarum was a much more modern platform, with better mobile support, and a attractive and innovative UI.</description>

      <description>As you all know, the Nightly builds have been down for some time now due to the former maintainer not being around, but the issues have been resolved, and the Nightly builds are now available on our downloads page once again! With downloads available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, you&amp;rsquo;re no longer required to compile the build yourself.
Likewise, we&amp;rsquo;d like to remind all users that any bugs found within Citra, or during emulation, be reported from the Nightly builds, and not the Bleeding Edge ones.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to wait. We&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that users are very excited about the future of Citra, which means wanting to try all of the changes all of the time. But, emulator development can be a slow, arduous process as new changes can bring big regressions and problems with the much wanted new features.
In order to satiate the needs of our users, we&amp;rsquo;ll be adding new builds for download: bleeding edge builds!</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an account already, you can make one for free here.
Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done that, you can join Citra&amp;rsquo;s official server by going here.

      <description>Special thanks must be given to fincs and the rest of the 3DS community for their work reverse-engineering the DSP firmware. Without that work, Citra would not be this far with audio emulation.
As of May 19th, 2016, Citra now has preliminary High Level Emulation (HLE) audio support! This means that users playing on Citra no longer have to listen to the deafening sound of silence in many titles. To get to this point was a huge reverse-engineering effort done by multiple people, with much of the reverse-engineering and the final implementation for Citra coming from MerryMage.</description>

      <description>One of the big things everyone has been wondering about Citra is when it will be able to render games at HD resolutions. One of the great things about emulators is that they can surpass the limitations of the original console, especially when it comes to graphical fidelity. With the 3DS specifically, many beautifully detailed games are hidden behind staggeringly low resolution screens topping out at 400x240. With Texture Forwarding (from tfarley, based on yuriks early implementation), Citra can now output games at any resolution, and runs faster as well!</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first Citra Progress Report of 2016! While 2015 will be considered the year that Citra first played games, 2016 is quickly shaping up as a year filled with higher compatibility, greater stability and much more as Citra matures. The avalanche of new features from tons of contributors has made it hard to keep up with everything even for developers!
Because there have been so many changes and there are so many different games, it can be very hard to keep up with what is working and what is not.</description>

      <description>This month we bring you the second installment of our two-part progress report on Citra in 2015! With this part, we discuss the evolution from Citra being able to barely run a few commercial games at a few frames-per-second, to where it is in 2016: Running many retail games at reasonable speeds, some of which are fully playable with near flawless graphics! We discuss Citra&amp;rsquo;s new &amp;ldquo;dyncom&amp;rdquo; CPU core, the OpenGL renderer, per-pixel lighting, and various bug fixes.</description>

      <description>While Citra was first founded in April of 2014, visible progress for the emulator didn&amp;rsquo;t really happen until the turn of the year. After a long struggle to get anything to boot, 2015 saw Citra evolve from an experimental emulator that couldn&amp;rsquo;t run games into an experimental emulator that can run games. And while it may not seem like Citra is that far along, it is truly amazing how much things have progressed in just a year since the first commercial title booted.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the brand new Citra website! This new site has been a sort of secret project off and on for over a year now. A lot of hard work, a few false starts, but here we are! This has been a big team effort - we&amp;rsquo;d like to especially thank Flame Sage, the primary architect behind the new website backend; MaJoR for the design and artwork, and lastly jchadwick for his early on role in the project.</description>
